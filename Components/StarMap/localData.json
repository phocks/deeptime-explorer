He asked why they weren't involved from the very start. Sian explained that this is part of that and while we have some ideas, we really want to hear their ideas about what's included.

Science confirms that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples’ connection to this land stretches so far back in time that it’s beyond the world as we know it. It goes back to a time when giant ancient marsupials weighing the same as a four-wheel-drive roamed the landscape. It spans an epic ice age, including a severe drought, and rising seas that swallowed huge chunks of the land. This landscape looks very different to the Australia we know today. Scientists call this Sahul. About 70,000 years ago sea levels were up to 70m lower than what they are today. People could technically walk from today’s Papua New Guinea all the way down to Tasmania. Researchers say people moved out of Africa and crossed here from south-east Asia. They estimate hundreds to thousands of people purposefully made the open-ocean crossing using advanced watercraft skills. Population and genetic modelling suggests at least 1,700 to 3,000 people made up the continent’s earliest population, and they then moved through the country in one phase. But it also indicates a very small number of new genes were introduced after that. **\n",

Most seem to have been extinct long before humans arrived on the continent\"\n\nMARGIE: Notes from Mike Bird: the period from 79,000 to 59,000 years ago is called marine isotope stage 4, and the madgebebe occupation at 65ka occurred during this period. THis was a period where sea level dropped by ~25m at 79,000 and then rose rapidly again by 25m at 60,000. So the coastline was changing dramatically when people arrived.\nNew-ish work by Partick De Deckker at ANU, suggests that in Australia this period could have been close to full glacial conditions, so colder (glaciers forming down south), air temperatures were colder... and this is when people initially arrived. So they arrived and then at 59,000, sea level jumped up by 25m (but still 70m below modern sea level), and climate warmed up again.\n\nAll of which is to say it would be good to have a segue spot at 59,000 (or 60,000), which separates the initial arrival of people in a cold sort of glacial Australia at 65,000 to a more 'normal' looking Australia after 60,000\n",

Cultural material including a 4,000-year-old plaited human-hair twin, possibly used in  making a belt, the oldest example of a bone tool found in Australia and early example of seed grinding technology. Information obtained from the excavated deposits also show the effects of climate change, the shift from open grass land to more wooded habitat, transformation from terrestrial foods to ones dominated by marine species.  All this provides insights into many tens of thousands of years of cultural history.\n\nNOTE:  Rio Tinto exploded two of these ancient rock shelters in May 2020 to expand its iron ore mine.[is this really relevant to the rest of the story being told]\n(FROM KEN MULVANEY: ARCHAEO ROCK ART EXPERT)\n\nSusan Standen 18/07/2021:\nPKKP is keen to write something focussing on the deep history rather than the more recent Juukan Cave incident.\nThe Comms company lead Casey Cahill has taken it to the PKKP board.\n\n",

Up to 90 of them, some spread across the country and others that stayed in certain areas.**\n\n**Exactly what caused many of them to die out is hotly debated among scientists.**\n\n**Some argue that it was caused by the slowly drying climate which meant freshwater in lakes and connecting waterways was less available and vegetation had changed.  **\n\n**Others say it was driven by humans hunting them. Because these huge animals had slow reproduction rates, they argue people wouldn’t have had to eat many individuals over thousands of years to tip their populations over the edge.**\n\n**Then others believe it’s a combination of both, or perhaps even fire that played a part. **\n\n**The reality is there are still many unknowns. **\n\n**However, tens of thousands of years later, some of these huge amazing animals live on in stories of First Nations peoples across the country. **\n\n\n",

Mungo Man and Mungo Lady are both buried around this time, 42,000-45,000 years ago, making them among the oldest homo sapiens found outside of Africa. Mungo Man, who is estimated to have been about 50, is carefully buried with his hands crossed in his lap. The use of fire, red ochre transported across a great distance and an extraordinarily defined grave suggest he was someone important, like the chief. Mungo Lady has also been ritually buried. First she has been cremated, then her bones crushed, burned again and buried in the lunette. \n",

His molar teeth are worn and scratched, which could have been the result of eating a gritty diet or stripping the long leaves of water reeds with his teeth to make twine. The way in which Mungo Lady was buried highlights complex spiritual beliefs and sophisticated burial practises of ancestors to the Paakantji, Ngyiampaa and Mutthi Mutthi people.Aboriginal people around the Willandra Lakes still use smoke to cleanse the dead.\n\nThis is one instance of many archeological digs which became a huge source of contention, as some communities believe removing remains and artefacts is disturbing the spirits of their people. Two years ago Mungo Man returned home to his descendants, travelling for days in a hearse from Canberra.\n",

Might be based on knowledge of phases of art. Could make a judgement to just include it, and deal with that. Research group who are well respected. As long as you’re aware of potential questioning. Also saying archeologists say, these archeologists say… \n\nDUNCAN WRIGHT, ARCHEOLOGIST: This age is contested. The site is very poorly dated.\n\nANNIE CARSON, WA MUSEUM: earliest rock art of Murjuuga is estimated to be around 40,000 years, likely older given that we know people are in the coastal and inland Pilbara area 50,000 years ago.  These depictions of the human face are known as Archaic Faces, and are among the earliest engraved rock art across Australia. But yes, they are among the oldest engravings at Murujuga, and oldest depictions of the human face\n\nThese could potentially be separated into two different stories. The main point of the climbing poles story is to get across the travelling stories/work 800km away.\n\nMargie needs to phone Ken Mulvaney to get more info on facts he has corrected\n\n\n From Jo McDonald (UWA)\nalmost correct – the dates are 8,000 calibrated years ago.  The picture on that website is on the MR 1 rockshelter excavation – not the stone house bases on Rosemary  – at MR1 the earliest evidence is from 22,000 years ago – i.e. during the ice age…\n\nsee attached original paper Island Coastal Archaeology from Jo.\n\n-  People developed a motif incorporating faces into their art on rocks at Murujuga, WA. They are the world’s oldest images of the human face. There are over one million engravings spread over 300 square kilometres recording the lives and spiritual beliefs of the first Australians. ~~Nearby ancient paintings showing people climbing poles were almost identical to paintings of figures 800km away. ~~[it is the faces and another style of anthropomorph that is found elsewhere; the ‘climbing figures are not known other than Murujuga] The area is home to the largest rock art gallery in the world.

      "CONTACT MADE": "20.05.2012 Hi Solua,\n\nI look forward to chatting at 1230 today but thought I’d put on paper where things are up to this end.\n\nFirstly, thanks for your patience.  At our Board of Directors meeting on 29 March, we discussed your project and who would be best to liaise with you for the story details.  It was decided:\n\nStory 1 – (sea level rise) – Roxanne Thomas, Brenton Yanner and Kyle Yanner \nStory 2 – (fish traps) – Brett Hills\n\nThere may be a problem in that Brett does not have a mobile phone so an interview with him will be a bit more juggling to sort, with getting him to the Rangers shed to do it from there.  Roxanne, Brenton and Kyle all have mobiles and will be easy to liaise with, although all 3 are really busy people so will need a definite time set to be able to sit them down for a decent chat.  Are you considering coming out to the Island to speak to people face to face?\n\nAfter our chat today, I’ll send through contact details and whatever else you’re needing from me to get the ball rolling.\nKind regards,\nRachael\n\nshe will be heading out June 12.\n\nThe community will have their board meeting on the 30th.\n10.05.2021:   has reached out to see how the board meeting went con call organised for friday\n\n",

They were creators, ancestral beings, who carried a sacred dillybag, filled with title deeds of the law. They travelled east, from their realm known as Barralku, throughout East Arnhem land, holding special ceremonies and naming places and animals along the way.  \n \nWhen the Djankawu sisters reached a place called Yawurr-Yawurr (mainland of Galiwinku), belonging to Liya-Guwumirri clan nation, they placed their special walking stick in the freshwater; and as a result, the water rose (separating what is now known as Galiwinku from the mainland). Children also emerged from the water and were told by the Djankawu sisters, that this was their land, their country, full of all their sacred things.  \n \nAfter they performed all their sacred ceremonies , the Djankawu sisters got hungry; so, they hung their sacred dillybag up safely, while they went to collect some shellfish and crabs in some nearby mangroves. While they were gathering their food, they heard a strange noise – They soon realised the strange sound was a man -singing sacred songs with a clapstick.  The Djankawu sisters, didn’t notice, the man had been following them since the start of the journey.\nLittle sister said to the big sister – “Yapa /sister – can you hear that song… the man just took the sacred title deeds dillybag of the law, from us!”. The man had claimed it as his own. \n \nThe sacred dillybag contains land, sea, - everything that we own. \n \nThey then decide – to cross from Yawurr-Yawurr to Galiwinku , performing a special ceremony – placing their sacred stick in the ground , naming this place Dhampala -  belonging to Malarra/Gunpirrtji clan nation. \n \nEver since the day, the man had taken the dillybag, women lost their rights to hold law. As a result, an “internal cabinet” was created, where the males took the dillybag (full of sacred law) and claimed they are the law makers. Even though, the women’s status shows they’ve lost the right of holding the law, they still demonstrate they are the mother of the earth and their right and power still exists from time memorial.  \n \n*side note only certain women still hold this this power/law – they are called- ngong-ganmirr \n",

When it comes to all Murujuga stories, sadly the original tribe of this area, Yabawarra were massacred. it's basically all of the neighbouring tribes that come together under Murujuga corporation. Jo says Susan Standen has a great reputation there, so it might be great to try and get her back involved and free her up in a more official capacity with her COS. Susan had reached out to Pete but hadn't heard back. Jo says he's an incredibly busy man but they are super interested in this kind of stuff (have been working on a timeline display with WA Museum).

      "STORY - ACTIVE, PRESENT TENSE, CONVERSATIONAL": "People in Arnhem Land paint the earliest battle scenes in the world. At Ngarradj-Warde-Djobkeng, two groups made up of 52 figures fight one another using spears, spear-throwers and hafted stone axes. The opposing sides are separated by a crack on the rock shelter wall, representing the East Alligator River. The leader on the right, who wears a large headdress, has a barbed spear through their abdomen. Rising sea levels push people further inland and force new relationships around land, as clans fight for shrinking resources and hunting grounds. \n",

Through shared trade and ceremonial networks, as well as increasingly abundant localized food and water resources of the freshwater period (see Tarpon 1989b), these territories eventually stabilized and linguistic, artistic, mythological and other differences became greater (Tagon 1993a,b; 1994)… Limited skirmishes are known to have taken place in the area in the past and Aboriginal elders remark that they portray previous fights over land\nor women.”\n** **\n  \n",

Possum’s skin is commonly used on the south-eastern side of the continent and in some areas of the south-western side (in what is to become known as south-east Queensland to Tasmania and across to the south-western areas of Western Australia). Cloaks serve multiple practical purposes including protection from the cold and rain and as baby carriers. \n\nSome other types of animal skins used to make cloaks include: kangaroo, sugar glider, wallaby, koala and more. \n\nThere are significant qualities of possum skin that differentiate it from the other animal cloaks and rugs. Its fibres are hollow and the fur has exemplary thermal properties to keep you warm or cool and dry; and further, the fur doesn’t freeze.\n\nAnimal skin cloaks are an important part of a person's identity and legacy. The make of the cloak itself and the sewing patterns used within them is very important. Individual designs are representational of all levels of knowledge the person holds.\n\nThis deep knowledge includes knowing one’s country, human behavior, and how the world works. Cloaks also tell stories of belonging, of place, and of the sacred and spiritual — representing unique and distinct tribes and language groups. Therefore they are highly treasured and used in ritual burials where people are laid to rest in their cloak.\n\nCloaks are also used in many other ceremonial and spiritual settings such as marriages, graduations, baby naming, and connection to country.  In what is to become known as Victoria, cloaks are often used as a shroud for boys going through initiation ceremonies, the cloaks are covered over the head and shoulders of the young men.",

To prepare seeds for consumption they would undergo a double\nyandying process. The seeds would initially be separated from their pods through threshing and\nrubbing and then yandied to separate them from the pod fragments. The seeds would then be baked\nin hot sand and ashes, requiring an additional yandying process to remove sand and ashes. Finally,\nthe seeds would be ground and moistened into a paste for consumption.\n\nI think these two can be separated\n..\nOTHER STORY (Yindjibarndi cration story) is in Removed tab.\n\n(info in curriculum booklet) Yandying is akin to the process of gold panning, and like winnowing is used to separate less dense particles from denser, desirable ones. A common purpose for yandying would be to separate sand, dirt or ash from seeds. In this technique, a mixture is placed in a wooden container called a yandy, a word used by the Yindjibarni people of the Pilbara region in Western Australia to describe a shallow dish similar to a koolamon, as well as the process of separation for which it is primarily used. The yandy is held in the hand, raised in one corner, and then gently shaken back and forth forcing the smaller and denser particles to collect at the bottom while the larger and less dense particles remain higher up.  \n\n\n",

To be successful, it requires an understanding of how the refraction and reflection of light can change the apparent position of the fish. On the mainland, along the country’s longest river, known today as the Murray River, men use technology and skills that allows them to catch two metre-long cod fish from bark canoes using technology. In the Ngurunderi dreaming story of the Ngarrindjeri people, as law giver Ngurunderi travels down a small stream looking for his two wives, a giant cod fish named Ponde widens the banks with sweeps of his tail, and Ngurunderi tries to spear him, forming the landscape that exists today.\n",

      "STORY - ACTIVE, PRESENT TENSE, CONVERSATIONAL": "HUNTING MANAGEMENT For thousands of years, the coastal waters of Australia are sustainably managed. Animals are purposefully harvested at specific times in their lifecycle, drawing on knowledge about population density and dynamics, to ensure the long-term survival of multiple species. For example, dugongs and turtles are culturally important species for many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. Up in the Gulf of Carpentaria on Yanyuwa country, people identify as ‘li-antha wirriyara’ or ‘people of the salt water’. Turtles are an ancestral being and according to law, it is only hunted by men at certain times of the year, they can only take what they need and it must be shared. Yanyuwa peoples use walya to refer to all dugong and sea turtles, but then have at least 16 different names to describe a dugong depending on its age, size, gender, and even its status within the herd. The ocean near here today is one of the last remaining safe havens for endangered marine animals including six of the world's seven marine turtles.\n",

The Yolngu people of the Northern Territory, have detailed stories that explain the motions of the moon, Ngalindi. and its relationships with the changing tides. When the tides are high, water fills the moon as it rises. As the water runs out of the Moon, the tides fall, leaving the Moon empty for three days.

The seasons aren’t linked to specific dates, but in different parts of the country relate to the positions of the Earth and sun, the stars in the sky, water movements or animal cycles.The calendars are created from a scientific knowledge of seasonal changes and weather patterns and mark the changes in plants or animals, the timing of journeys or important events.In the southwest of Australia, the Nyoongar seasonal calendar divides the yearly cycle into six parts from Makuru (season of fertility) in June/July through to Djeran (season of adulthood) in April/May. The Tiwi calendar is divided into just three - Jamutakari (wet season), Kumunupunari (dry season) and Tiyari (hot, wet, humid season known as ‘the build up’ in English). The Yirrganydji calendar in Far North Queensland recongises five seasons including Jimburralji (cyclone time) and Wumbulji (hot and humid build up time before the wet season). On D'harawal Country around Sydney, their seasons are recognised by change in animal and plant behaviour, like when male kangaroos become aggressive and when quolls or echidnas are looking for mates. \n",

The use of star maps is one form of navigation and it is how the Kamillaroi and Euahlayi people from Goodooga in north-west New South Wales make journeys of up to 700km. Rather than using the stars as direction points, people use words from songlines telling them how to navigate, along with star patterns that remind them of things like water holes or turning points on the route. One of the star maps takes them to the Bunya Mountains in Wakka Wakka country, Queensland, where a nut festival happens every three years. Astronomy also offers practical information, tools for survival and lore. In the Torres Strait, the constellation of the great warrior Tagai, whose left hand is represented by the Southern Cross, helps fishermen navigate between the islands. The stars also help signal the best time to plant, hunt for turtles or dugongs, and the start of monsoon season.\n",

They are surrounded by smaller fish, boomerangs and what appears to be throwing sticks.  \n \nOn the lower north shore, Cammeraygal people engrave what appears to be a large whale with four fins with a male figure inside of it. It's engraved into stone which overlooks the harbor waters below. The engraving of the large sea mammal is taller than an adult man.\n",
      "FACT BOX": "The engravings of dugongs in Garigal National Park suggests the large sea mammal once roamed Sydney waters. A 6000-year-old dugong fossil was found in Botany Bay in 2004. This means the water is likely to have been much warmer - like the waters in sub-tropical Queensland where dugongs are commonly found. \n",

      "STORY - ACTIVE, PRESENT TENSE, CONVERSATIONAL": "The star constellation of the seven sisters tells a dreaming story. It holds important lessons of family bonds, kinship and creation of the land. The seven sisters were chased across this continent from west to east by a lustful man who was filled with desire upon seeing the beautiful women. The sisters had to constantly be on the lookout for him, always looking over their shoulders. Their story is shared across many language groups and is etched in the land of many tribes.\n\nAcross the central and western deserts, he is known as Wati Nyiru and Yurla to the Martu, Ngaanyatjarra and the Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara peoples. Wati Nyiru is an ancestral being, he is also a shape shifter. \n\nTo the Wirangu people in South Australia he is a hunter known as Tgilby and the sisters are known as Yugarilya.\n\nAcross all of these groups, the man is represented in - what is to be named by the Greeks - the Orion constellation. And the seven sisters reside in the star cluster known as the Pleiades. \n\nThe Yamaji people of Western Australia refer to the seven sisters as Nyarluwarri in the Wajarri language. When the consultation sits low on the horizon at sunset, they know to hunt for emu eggs. Throughout their journey, the seven sisters out run the man's advances towards them. The oldest sister has the responsibility of looking out for the younger ones as they hide from him. They create multiple songlines and dreaming tracks throughout their journey, leaving their stories in the shape of the land. Every night the man can be seen to the south of the seven sisters, as he still chases them across the sky. It is an eternal chase that lives on.\n",

The Wardani people would collect their water near the cave’s entrance and had everything they needed until one day, an evil spirit called Wolgine began lurking inside. He caused food to become scarce and would lure people to a great hole of darkness – never to be seen again. Ngilgi, a good spirit who once lived in the ocean, watched over the tribes in the area. When he saw what was going on he plotted with the other good spirits to create an aggressive storm that would get rid of Wolgine. Huge waves forced him further and further into the cave and when he begged for mercy, Ngilgi let him go but told him to never come back. Wolgine burst out of the cave, creating a new entrance. With the evil spirit gone, the food became abundant again and Ngilgi claimed the cave as his home.\n",

Over this period, climates across the land were exceptionally variable, but there was an overall trend towards more drier, arid conditions across the land. \n\nThere were a lot of different species. Up to 90 of them. Some of them were spread across the country and others were found in certain habitats.\n\nSaltwater crocodiles, red kangaroos, cassowaries and emus are all types of megafauna that still exist in our country today. Elsewhere the likes of elephants, gorillas, bisons and anacondas are all considered megafauna too. \n\nSome people assume that megafauna are larger ancestors of modern-day species, but actually all of the animal species that exist today lived alongside them. \n\nWhat exactly caused many giant animal species to die out is hotly debated among scientists, and the reality is there are still many unknowns. \n\nSome researchers argue that it was caused by a drying climate over a long period, with freshwater in lakes and connecting waterways becoming less available and vegetation changing. Others say it was driven by humans hunting them, and because these huge animals had slow reproduction rates, people wouldn’t have had to eat many individuals over thousands of years to tip their populations over the edge. Then others argue it’s a combination of both, or perhaps even fire that played a part. \n",
